#Geonet NZ Ninja
Geonet NZ Ninja is an exploration into node as much as it is a taste of the Ninja Block Developers Tools
The simple 30 line app fetches a json file every 5 seconds from Geonet
and changes Nina's Eye colour depending on the magnitude of the most
recent quake.

##Installation
`
git clone https://github.com/jghazally/geonet-nz-ninja.git
cd geonet-nz-ninja
npm install
cp sample.secrets.json secrets.json
`
You will need to add in your Ninja Block API Key into the secrets.json
file.
